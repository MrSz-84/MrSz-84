## **Data Enthusiast & Python Developer**

### Hello, and welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm **Marcin**, a self-taught programmer with a passion for **data**. My main interests lie in **Python, SQL, DAX**, and the **Google Cloud Platform** ecosystem, with a specific focus on **BigQuery**.

This is the place where I share my projects. I primarily focus on **data collection, manipulation, cleaning, and analysis**. I am fascinated by the process of transforming raw information into useful solutions that support decision-making. I enjoy planning and implementing **automated data pipelines** that run smoothly and flawlessly. I find great satisfaction in the moment when all the work comes to life, and data powers **charts and dashboards** for the users' benefit.
