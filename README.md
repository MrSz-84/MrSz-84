- 👋 Hi, I’m Marcin aka @MrSz-84 and i live in Wroclaw (Poland)
- 👀 I’m interested in changing my life and learn how to code, design and develop programs, what is used in this process, what tolls this industry uses, such a s Git, Linux, etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning basics of programming in Python. I Use PCAP Python Essentials, and some other coursen on Udemy and YT. Currently crunching OOP... Bit complicated but learnable I think.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any open source Python project for beginners. That would be nice experience to see how the process of development looks like and how real pros code :) Maby I could learn a bit from it, especially how much I don't know and what ealse to learn. Who knows.
- 📫 How to reach me? On GitHub, an via e-mail pokeplacek@gmail.com
